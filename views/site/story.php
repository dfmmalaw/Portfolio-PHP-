        Hi! My name is Dean Friedland and I am 
        learning how to code. I created this basic CRUD application so that devs
        of all levels can leave tips for those who are also on the journey of learning how to 
        code. Please pay it forward by adding a piece of knowledge that you wish
        someone would have told you along the way... Thank you!!!
    </p>
