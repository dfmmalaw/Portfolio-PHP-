    <p>
        My story may not be much different from others that fell into the world 
        of "coding". At 32 I still wasn't sure what I wanted do with the rest of
        my life, and being a husband, father and provider made this feeling of uncertainty 
        unbearable. I knew there had to be something that I would be happy doing 
        on a daily basis and would allow me to be financially secure. Enter 
        programming! But first some background...
    </p>
        
     <p>During law school I did my clinic at the prosecutor's office in Atlanta, 
        GA. I absolutely loved being in the court room and because of something 
        called the Third Year Practice Act I was able to try my own cases. It was 
        awesome to say the least. In fact, my plan was to take the bar and become 
        a prosecutor after I graduated. 
    </p>
        
    <p> Fast forward, I graduated from law school and took a job teaching and also as
        the program chair of a criminal justice program at a local college. I was
        there for a little over a year until I was offered a position as a Director 
        of Education at another school. Soon after I realized that management in 
        education was not what I wanted to do the rest of my life. 
    </p>
        
    <p> I ended up leaving Georgia with my wife and three month old daughter and
        heading to Florida to take a position with a family member's start-up 
        software company. I immediately fell in love with the tech industry! Everything
        from the technical aspects of the software development life cycle to the 
        legal aspect of intellectual property just seemed to make sense to me. I 
        had a chance to be a part of the re-architecture of the software starting 
        at the design and through its eventual implementation. I was also blown
        away by the designers and developers and what they were able to create. I 
        knew immediately that I would have to learn how to code if I was ever 
        going to really understand the technical side of things. 
    </p>
        
    <p> I took a remote position with a software development company as a project
        manager and recruiter. They built FAST and there was no real requirements 
        gathering going on. It was not what I was used to but it was great to see 
        how different it can be from one company to another. I learned a lot from 
        a project management perspective. As much as I was learning about the SDLC
        I was not learning about actual coding. 
    </p>
        
    <p> That is when I dedided to take one of the biggest leaps in faith that I have 
        ever taken and quit my job to start a dev bootcamp. I ended up going to LAMP
        camp, and from the name you can guess that it is a full-stack PHP program.
        The only difference is that it is not a dev bootcamp. It is subsidized by 
        a software company called The Cresca Group and us Junior Developers get to 
        work on their client's "enterprise level" web applications. They started 
        off by introducing us to their proprietary MVC framework that was built 
        in-house and gave us a lesson in Object Oriented Programming. I can not
        begin to explain how lost I felt at this point. It was law school all over
        again! 
    </p>
        
    <p> I won't lie, I thought about quitting about 10 times that week and signing
        up for a traditional dev bootcamp. Thank god I didn't because I know now
        how different of an experience it would have been. There is big differnce
        when you are dealing with key business decisions and from my short time at
        LAMP camp I learned how to take requirements, clarify, develop and iterate. 
        That was priceless! 
    </p>
        
    <p> I also know now where I want to go with my programming in the future. I 
        was hired by a tech recruting company recently as a senior recruiter and
        I cannot wait to begin. I wil continue coding in the evening and getting 
        as much freelance work as I can. I want to continue to progress and will 
        not let anything slow me down.
    </p>
        
    <p>    I also want to gain further knowledge of intellectual property law and as
        I see it being a big part of my future. I think some forget how important 
        the legal aspect of appliction development actually is. </br>
