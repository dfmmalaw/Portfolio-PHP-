        Hi! My name is Dean Friedland and this site is about me and my journey of 
        learning how to code. I have an incredible wife (Ashley), daughter (Reese), 
        and son on the way. There is nothing better than being a husband and father. 
        I love all things martial arts and will train and compete in Brazilian 
        Jiu Jitsu until the day I die! I also love to surf and have water in my 
        blood. I am currently living in Georgia and the closest beach is hours 
        away which I hate.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am originally from South Africa but have lived in the 
        US since I was a kid after a six year stint in Canada. I have also lived
        in both Ecuador and Costa Rica (both of which have killer
        waves) and am blessed to have traveled to many other countries in this amazing
        world.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope you enjoy my site and please let me know if you would like me to 
        add any content. Thanks for visiting!
    </p>
