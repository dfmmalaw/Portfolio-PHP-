        Hi! My name is Dean Friedland and this site is about me and my journey of 
        learning how to code. I have an incredible wife (Ashley), daughter (Reese), 
        and son on the way. There is nothing better than being a husband and father. 
        I love all things martial arts and will train and compete in Brazilian 
        Jiu Jitsu until the day I die! I also love to surf and have water in my 
        blood. I am currently living in Georgia and the closest beach is hours 
        way which I hate.
    </p>

        I am originally from South Africa but have lived in the 
        US since I was a kid after a six year stint in Canada. I have also lived
        for few months in both Ecuador and Costa Rica (both of which have killer
        waves) and am blessed to have traveled to many other countries in this amazing
        world.
