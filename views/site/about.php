        Hi! My name is Dean Friedland and I am 
        learning how to code. I created this basic CRUD application so that experienced
        devs can leave tips for those who are beginning their journeys of learning how to 
        code. Please pay it forward by adding a piece of knowledge that you wish
        someone would have given you along the way... Thank you!!!
    </p>
